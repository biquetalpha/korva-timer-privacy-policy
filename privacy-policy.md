Privacy Policy

Korva Timer does not collect personal data directly from users. We do not require users to create an account, share personal details, or provide any identifiable information within the app.

However, we use third-party services, such as Google AdMob, Firebase Analytics, and Firebase Crashlytics, which may collect data to provide personalized ads, improve app performance, and diagnose issues.

Third-Party Data Collection:

    Google AdMob: AdMob collects data such as device identifiers and advertising IDs to display personalized ads and improve ad relevance.
    Firebase Analytics: Firebase Analytics collects data on how users interact with the app, such as session duration and event tracking, to help us improve user experience.
    Firebase Crashlytics: Crashlytics collects data on app crashes to help us diagnose and fix issues, improving app stability.

Data Usage:

    Data collected by third-party services is used for advertising, performance monitoring, and diagnostic purposes.
    These services may collect data such as device identifiers, usage patterns, crash logs, and advertising IDs. The data is primarily used to provide a better user experience and to optimize app performance.

Control Over Data:

    Users can opt out of personalized ads by adjusting their device settings (e.g., disabling "personalized ads" in the Android or iOS privacy settings).

For more information on the data collected by Google services, please refer to Google's Privacy Policy at https://policies.google.com/privacy.

By using Korva Timer, you agree to the collection and use of your data as outlined in this Privacy Policy. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to contact us at [mikael.robin@hotmail.fr].
